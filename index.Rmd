## Summary: What is the Landsat-9?

- Landsat-9 was launched by NASA & the USGS in September 2021 and measures energy reflected and emitted by the Earth using *passive sensors*
- The satellite extends the Landsat legacy, offering precise data on Earth's landscapes using the OLI-2 and TIRS-2 sensors
- The Landsat programme has an open data policy democratising access to environmental insights and supporting scientific research
- Focuses on "...monitoring the Earth's terrestrial, coastal, and near-shore environments" (NASA, 2021)

## Resolution & Specifications

Spectral Resolution:
* Suitable for landscape-level forest structure and dynamics
* Equipped with spectral bands that span the visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. This helps the observation of terrestrial and polar regions

Spatial Resolution:
* High spatial resolution of 30m for detailed observation of vegetation and landscape changes. Below is a diagram showing all Landsat bands:

## Summary: Key Facts & Figures

- **Orbital Frequency:** Landsat 9 completes around 14 orbits daily with a 99-minute per orbit frequency, ensuring detailed Earth surface monitoring

- **Mapping Cycle:** It offers complete Earth coverage every 16 days, achieving an 8-day revisit in collaboration with Landsat 8 for timely observations.

- **Operational Lifetime:** Designed for a minimum 5-year mission, Landsat 9 aims to exceed this, continuing the legacy of its long-serving predecessors.

- **Resolution:** Resolution of 30 meters for multispectral imagery, 15 meters for panchromatic and 100 meters for thermal bands

## Overview: Landsat-9 Capability

Landsat 9 captures scenes across a swath 185 kilometers wide. Each pixel in these images is 30 meters across. The satellite has two thermal bands, which can detect heat from wildfires and volcanic activity. It's panchromatic band can capture black-and-white images at a resolution of 15 meters per pixel. 

Below are two examples of a Landsat 9 images. The first is of the California wildfires in 2021 and the second is first photo taken by the Landsat 9 (Western Australia)

## Lansat-9: Improvements in Monitoring Efficiency

* The new satellite will add more than 700 *scenes* of Earth to the mission’s archive each day

* When Landsat 9 joins Landsat 8 in orbit, the two satellites together will be able to image each *swath* of the globe every eight days.

## Application 1 - Tracking Water Quality

**Spotting Algal Blooms from Space** When toxin-containing aquatic organisms multiply and form a bloom, it can sicken people and contaminate drinking water. With its medium resolution, Landsat can gather data on smaller lakes than other satellites can, allowing scientists to track water quality information for smaller bodies of water than ever before

## Application 2 - Disaster Response

**Burned Area Emergency Response Maps** Burned Area Emergency Response maps will be essential in determining where a wildfire destroyed vegetation and identifying where to focus emergency restoration efforts. These maps can save federal agencies "...as much as $7.7 million annually in post-fire costs"

## Application 3: Studies using L-9 Data
The Landsat 9 Satellite has only been in orbit for 3 years, thus, the studies using entirely L-9 data are still in their infancy. However, the following studies have begun using L-9 data in conjunction with L-8 data:

#### **1.** *Monitoring of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest*
- The Landsat 9 satellite will provide invaluable data for monitoring deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, including monitoring of land use changes, deforestation, and the impact of climate change on the rainforest.

#### **2.** *Assessment of the impact of climate change on the Greenland ice sheet*
- The Landsat 9 satellite will provide invaluable data for monitoring the impact of climate change on the Greenland ice sheet, including monitoring of glacier retreat, ice melt, and the impact of climate change on the ice sheet.

## Reflections

* **LandSat 9, from my reading, seems to be a leap forward in remote sensing capabilities, from a technical point of view**. The new OLI-2 and TIRS-2 sensors will provide improved data quality and L-9 combined with L-8 will accelerate the pace in which we can collect EO data

* The Landsat programme is one of the most utilised EO databases ever. This project is general, multipurpose and pretty good for most applications. However, it was interesting to take a look at some of the lesser known satelites that specialise in fire or water monitoring such as MODIS or VIIRS.

* I am very excited to keep learning about the different applications and better understand if this is an area of spatial science I would like to pursue further.
